## General Troubleshooting
This guide will try to fix Suwayomi by reseting it to a clean installation state.

- Make sure you have a recent backup of your library or create one in the app (if possible) because we **are going to wipe all Suwayomi data**.
- Make sure Suwayomi is not running (right click on tray icon and quit or kill it through the way your Operating System provides)
- Clear all browsing data on your browser if you use Suwayomi from a browser.
- Delete the Suwayomi data directory located below and re-run the app.

Note: Replace `<Account>` with the currently logged in account/username on your pc.

On Mac OS X : `/Users/<Account>/Library/Application Support/Tachidesk`

On Windows XP : `C:\Documents and Settings\<Account>\Application Data\Local Settings\Tachidesk`

On Windows 7 and later : `C:\Users\<Account>\AppData\Local\Tachidesk`

On Unix/Linux : `/home/<account>/.local/share/Tachidesk`

- In the case that you have to periodically perform this fix or the problem persists or the method failed to fix it, open an issue or Join the [Suwayomi discord server](https://discord.gg/DDZdqZWaHA) to hang out with the community and to receive support and help.
