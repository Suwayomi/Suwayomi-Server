Ability to read and write Tachiyomi compatible backups and syncing is a planned feature.

## Is this application usable? Should I test it?
Here is a list of current features:

- Installing and executing Tachiyomi's Extensions, So you'll get the same sources.
- A library to save your mangas and categories to put them into.
- Searching and browsing installed sources.
- A decent chapter reader.
- Ability to download Manga for offline read
- Backup and restore support powered by Tachiyomi Legacy Backups

**Note:** Keep in mind that Tachidesk is alpha software and can break rarely and/or with each update. See [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk/wiki/Troubleshooting) if it happens.

## Downloading and Running the app
### All Operating Systems
You should have The Java Runtime Environment(JRE) 8 or newer and a modern browser installed(Google is your friend for seeking assitance). Also an internet connection is required as almost everything this app does is downloading stuff. 

Download the latest "Stable" jar release from [the releases section](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk/releases) or a preview jar build from [the preview repository](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk-preview/releases).

Double click on the jar file or run `java -jar Tachidesk-vX.Y.Z-rxxx.jar` (or `java -jar Tachidesk-latest.jar` if you have the latest preview) from a Terminal/Command Prompt window to run the app which will open a new browser window automatically. Also the System Tray Icon is your friend if you need to open the browser window again or close Tachidesk.

### Windows
Download the latest "Stable" win32 or win64 (depending on your system, usually you want win64) release from [the releases section](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk/releases) or a preview one from [the preview repository](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk-preview/releases).

The Windows specific build has java bundled inside, so you don't have to install java to use it. Unzip `Tachidesk-vX.Y.Z-rxxx-win64.zip` and run one of the Launcher files depending on what you want(see bellow). The rest works like the previous section.
#### Windows Launchers
- `Tachidesk Electron Launcher.bat`: Launches Tachidesk inside Electron as a desktop applicaton
- `Tachidesk Browser Launcher.bat`: Launches Tachidesk in a browser window
- `Tachidesk Debug Launcher.bat`: Launches Tachidesk with debug logs attached. If Tachidesk doesn't work for you, running this can give you insight into why.
