# Tachidesk
<img src="https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk/raw/master/server/src/main/resources/icon/faviconlogo.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

A free and open source manga reader that runs extensions built for [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/). 

Tachidesk is an independent Tachiyomi compatible software and is **not a Fork of** Tachiyomi.

Tachidesk is as multi-platform as you can get. Any platform that runs java and/or has a modern browser can run it. This includes Windows, Linux, macOS, chrome OS, etc. Follow [Downloading and Running the app](#downloading-and-running-the-app) for installation instructions.

Ability to read and write Tachiyomi compatible backups and syncing is a planned feature.

**Tachidesk needs serious front-end dev help for it's reader and other parts, if you like the app and want to see it become better please don't hesitate to contribute some code!**

## Is this application usable? Should I test it?
Here is a list of current features:

- Installing and executing Tachiyomi's Extensions, So you'll get the same sources.
- A library to save your mangas and categories to put them into.
- Searching and browsing installed sources.
- A decent chapter reader.
- Ability to download Mangas for offline read(This partially works)
- Backup and restore support powered by Tachiyomi Legacy Backups

**Note:** Keep in mind that Tachidesk is alpha software and can break rarely and/or with each update. See [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk/wiki/Troubleshooting) if it happens.

## Downloading and Running the app
### All Operating Systems
You should have The Java Runtime Environment(JRE) 8 or newer and a modern browser installed(Google is your friend for seeking assitance). Also an internet connection is required as almost everything this app does is downloading stuff. 

Download the latest "Stable" jar release from [the releases section](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk/releases) or a preview jar build from [the preview branch](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk/tree/preview).

Double click on the jar file or run `java -jar Tachidesk-vX.Y.Z-rxxx.jar` (or `java -jar Tachidesk-latest.jar` if you have the latest preview) from a Terminal/Command Prompt window to run the app which will open a new browser window automatically. Also the System Tray Icon is your friend if you need to open the browser window again or close Tachidesk.

### Windows
Download the latest win32 release from [the releases section](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk/releases).

The Windows specific build has java bundled inside, so you don't have to install java to use it. Unzip `Tachidesk-vX.Y.Z-rxxx-win64.zip` and run `Tachidesk Launcher.exe` or `Tachidesk Launcher.bat`. The rest works like the previous section.

### Arch Linux
You can install Tachidesk from the AUR
```
yay -S tachidesk
```

### Docker
Check [arbuilder's repo](https://github.com/arbuilder/Tachidesk-docker) out for more details and the dockerfile.

### Using Tachidesk Remotely
You can run Tachidesk on your computer or a server and connect to it remotely through the web interface with a web browser on any device including a mobile or tablet or even your smart TV!, this method of using Tachidesk is only recommended if you are a power user and know what you are doing.
