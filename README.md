# What is Suwayomi?
<img src="https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server/raw/master/server/src/main/resources/icon/faviconlogo.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

A free and open source manga reader server that runs extensions built for [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/). 

Suwayomi is an independent Tachiyomi compatible software and is **not a Fork of** Tachiyomi.

Suwayomi-Server is as multi-platform as you can get. Any platform that runs java and/or has a modern browser can run it. This includes Windows, Linux, macOS, chrome OS, etc. Follow [Downloading and Running the app](#downloading-and-running-the-app) for installation instructions.

Ability to sync with Tachiyomi is a planned feature, for more info look [here](#syncing-with-tachiyomi).

## Advanced Methods

In order to run the app you need the following:
- The jar release of Suwayomi-Server
- The Java Runtime Environment(JRE) 8 or newer
- A Browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.
- ElectronJS (optional)

Download the latest `.jar` release from [the releases section](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server/releases) or a preview jar build from [the preview repository](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server-preview/releases).

### Using Suwayomi Remotely
You can run Suwayomi on your computer or a server and connect to it remotely through one of our clients or the bundled web interface with a web browser. This method of using Suwayomi is requiring a bit of networking/firewall/port forwarding/server configuration/etc. knowledge on your side, if you can run a Minecraft server and configure it, then you are good to go.

## Syncing With Tachiyomi
### The Suwayomi extension and tracker
- You can install the `Suwayomi` extension inside tachiyomi.
- The extension will load your Suwayomi library.
- By manipulating extension search filters you can browse your categories.
- You can enable the Suwayomi tracker to track reading progress with your Suwayomi server.
  - Note: Tachiyomi [only allows tracking one way](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi/issues/1626), meaning that by reading chapters on other Suwayomi clients the last read chapter number will update on the tracker but tachiyomi won't automatically mark them as read for you.

### Other methods
Checkout [this issue](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server/issues/159) for tracking progress.
