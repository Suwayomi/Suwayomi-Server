# Downloading and Running the app
## Using Operating System Specific Bundles
To facilitate the use of Suwayomi we provide bundle releases that include The Java Runtime Environment, ElectronJS and the Suwayomi-Launcher.

If a bundle for your operating system or cpu architecture is not provided then refer to [Advanced Methods](#advanced-methods)

### Windows
Download the latest `win64`(Windows 64-bit) release from [the releases section](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server/releases) or a preview one from [the preview repository](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server-preview/releases).

Unzip the downloaded file and double-click on one of the launcher scripts.

### macOS
Download the latest `macOS-x64`(older macOS systems) or `macOS-arm64`(Apple M1 and newer) release from [the releases section](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server/releases) or a preview one from [the preview repository](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server-preview/releases).

Unzip the downloaded file and double-click on one of the launcher scripts.

### GNU/Linux
Download the latest `linux-x64`(x86_64) release from [the releases section](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server/releases) or a preview one from [the preview repository](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server-preview/releases).

`tar xvf` the downloaded file and double-click on one of the launcher scripts or run them using the terminal.

#### WebView support (GNU/Linux)

WebView support is implemented via [KCEF](https://github.com/DATL4G/KCEF).
This is optional, and is only necessary to support some extensions.

To have a functional WebView, several dependencies are required; aside from X11 libraries necessary for rendering Chromium, some JNI bindings are necessary: gluegen and jogl (found in Ubuntu as `libgluegen2-jni` and `libjogl2-jni`).
Note that on some systems (e.g. Ubuntu), the JNI libraries are not automatically found, see below.

A KCEF server is launched on startup, which loads the X11 libraries.
If those are missing, you should see "Could not load 'jcef' library".
If so, use `ldd ~/.local/share/Tachidesk/bin/kcef/libjcef.so | grep not` to figure out which libraries are not found on your system.

The JNI bindings are only loaded when a browser is actually launched.
This is done by extensions that rely on WebView, not by Suwayomi itself.
If there is a problem loading the JNI libraries, you should see a message indicating the library and the search path.
This search path includes the current working directory, if you do not want to modify system directories.

Refer to the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server-docker/blob/main/Dockerfile) for more details.

## Other methods of getting Suwayomi
### Docker

Source code for our container is available at [docker-tachidesk](https://github.com/Suwayomi/docker-tachidesk), an example compose file can also be found there. By default, the server will be running on http://localhost:4567 open this url in your browser.

### Arch Linux

> makedeb -si
> ```
> ### Ubuntu
> ```
> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:suwayomi/tachidesk-server
> sudo apt update
> sudo apt install tachidesk-server

### NixOS
You can deploy Suwayomi on NixOS using the module `services.suwayomi-server` in your configuration:

```
{
  services.suwayomi-server = {
    enable = true;
  };
}
```

For more information, see [the NixOS manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#module-services-suwayomi-server).

You can also directly use the package from [nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&type=packages&query=suwayomi-server).

## Advanced Methods
### Running the jar release directly
In order to run the app you need the following:
- The jar release of Suwayomi-Server
- The Java Runtime Environment(JRE) 21 or newer
- A Browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.
- ElectronJS (optional)

Download the latest `.jar` release from [the releases section](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server/releases) or a preview jar build from [the preview repository](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server-preview/releases).

Make sure you have The Java Runtime Environment installed on your system, Double-click on the jar file or run `java -jar Suwayomi-Server-vX.Y.Z-rxxxx.jar` from a Terminal/Command Prompt window to run the app which will open a new browser window automatically.

### Using Suwayomi Remotely
You can run Suwayomi on your computer or a server and connect to it remotely through one of our clients or the bundled web interface with a web browser. This method of using Suwayomi is requiring a bit of networking/firewall/port forwarding/server configuration/etc. knowledge on your side, if you can run a Minecraft server and configure it, then you are good to go.

Check out [this wiki page](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server/wiki/Configuring-Tachidesk-Server) for a guide on configuring Suwayomi-Server.
